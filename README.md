I created a fittness tracker by creating api routes that would allow the user to select the type of workout they perform each week and use the fitness tracking by clicking etheir new workout to start a new workout or continue workout to continue where they left off.  I made sure all the functions were defined and connected to my server, and also exercise html and exercise.js to make sure everything appears correctly in the counsole.  I created an app that would not only connect to Heroku but to MongoAtlas as well after I set up an account on MongoAtlas.
